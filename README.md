## Coursework
Final Mark: **100/100**

Submission requirements</br>
  1. Each query must be written in a plain-text file named XY.sql (with lowercase extension) where XY is the two-digit number that identifies the query in the assignment sheet. So, for example, the first query will be written in file 01.sql and the last one in file 10.sql. The character encoding of the file must be ASCII.</br>
  2. Query files must be submitted individually, so your submission will consist of one file for each query you choose to attempt. Archives, PDF documents, files in other formats or named differently than how specified in point 1 above will not be accepted. Learn will allow you to submit them, but they will not processed for execution and marking.</br>
  3. Each query file must consist of a single SQL statement, terminated by semicolon ";". Submitted files that do not contain exactly one semicolon will be discarded. Please pay attention to this; even though it looks like a trivial detail, it is not. If a file contains more than one statement, or a statement that is not a query (such as CREATE VIEW or UPDATE), it will fail. Do not use comments either, as they may cause a correct query to fail if they contain semicolons.</br>

Query requirements</br>
  1. Your queries can only use the SQL constructs we have seen in class and cannot use any of the keywords listed in the forbidden.txt file (please note the list include NULL). Do not use any of these words in your queries, even if only as identifiers (column/table/subquery aliases).</br>
  2. The names of the columns in the answers are also irrelevant and they can be renamed as you wish in the SELECT clause, as long as the chosen names do not appear in the list of forbidden keywords (see point 1 above). What is important is the number of columns and the order in which they appear in the output. Columns must be returned in the order indicated in the query specification.</br>
  3. The order in which the rows appear in the answers to your queries is irrelevant for this assignment. No ordering is enforced on the answers, so the DBMS will output rows in an arbitrary order.</br>
